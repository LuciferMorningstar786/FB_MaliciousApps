I have often wanted to do so even before Facebook totally screwed up anyway.  This could be useful in a few ways:\n\n1.\tSome people are just not all that computer savvy and have trouble using the Bitstrip app themselves\n2.\tSome people are not on Facebook\n\nAnd there are probably several other reasons where this would be useful (celebs, whatever).  \n\nI created numerous Bitstrip avatars of my family and friends.  I frequently got likes and favorable comments.  So, I think what Facebook has done is extremely stupid….because it provides less content and reason for users to get on their site."},"6":{"user":"Lorna Jaine Day","message":"what crap totally ruined a great app of which ill no longer be using may aswel get rid of the app all together"},"7":{"user":"Shakiris Sibrianoski","message":"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO mY HUSBAND is not there anymore  :( :("},"8":{"user":"Teri Lin Paukert","message":"Sucks"}}},"1":{"shares":5,"likes":25,"message":"TGIF!

We're not able to respond to everyone individually, but will read your message in the next 24 hours. Please read on for answers to common questions.\n\nKnown Bugs and Issues \n- Text bubble options like Shout and Whisper are currently unavailable due to technical changes we've made to the app. We hope to bring them back soon.\n\n- Captions attached to comics do not appear when shared outside of Bitstrips. We are working to fix this issue.\n\n- Designing and editing a friend’s avatar is no longer possible due to changes Facebook has made to how it shares user information with developers. We are sorry to have to remove this feature.\n\n- Comics shared via chat apps or saved to photo gallery are missing captions. We are working on resolving this issue.\n\n- Can't Remove Headwear: This is a known bug and we are working on a fix that will be available soon.\n\nDeleting your Bitstrips account \nPlease follow these instructions to delete your account: https://www.facebook.com/help/www/170585223002660 - Note that you need to delete the app from your mobile device and from your Facebook account.
